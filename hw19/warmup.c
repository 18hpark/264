/******************************************************************************************\
 * Instructions:
 *
 * Fill in each function, according to the description following the restrictions below.
 *
 * To compile this file use this command:
 * gcc -o warmup warmup.c print_bits.o
 *
 * RESTRICTIONS:
 * ∙ The body of every function must be exactly one statement, except for print_bits(…)
 *   which must be exactly 3 statements.
 * ∙ Do not use the constant 0xff in create_string_of_eight_1s().  Other functions are fine.
 *   In fact, you *should* use it in other functions.
 *
 * The comments in this file write numbers in bits like this:  11111111₂ or 10111010₂.
 *
 * C11 does not actually accept constants like that. When writing code that uses bit
 * manipulations, always write constants in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 0xff for 11111111₂,
 * 0xBA for 10111010₂), except zero, which you can write as either 0 or 0x00 (your choice).
 *
 * Note:  The last file ends with ".o" not ".c".  It is a compiled "object file".  We are
 * giving you code you can use to diagnose the correctness of your other code, while also
 * asking you to implement the print_bits(…)  function.
 * 
 * The two functions provided by print_bits.o are described in print_bits.h.
 *
 * You may add anything you like to the main(…) function.  If you do not want to use
 * the functions in print_bits.o, you may remove the #include "print_bits.h".
